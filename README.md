# AdventOfCode2015

These are my solutions to the advent of code problems. They are all coded in python. The code was mainly designed to be short but readable, which implies that difficult to read one-liners are intentionally not included. 

To run the code, navigate to the main directory of the project and execute the following command:

$ python main.py *day* *part*

Here the day is an int between 1-25, and part is 1 or 2. For this command and the results to make sense, visit the advent of code website [here](http://adventofcode.com/)

NB: 
- The input varies for different users, my results are based of my input found in the file named data.txt or input.txt for each day
- Part 2 does not exist for day 25
